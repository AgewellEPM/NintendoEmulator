# 🎮 Player 2 AI Support - COMPLETE! 🤖

## Overview
The AI Agent can now be **Player 2** (or Player 3 or 4) in multiplayer N64 games!

---

## What's New

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

1. **Multi-Controller Memory Support** (`N64InputMemoryInjector.swift`)
   - Controllers stored as array in mupen64plus memory
   - Each BUTTONS structure is 4 bytes:
     - Player 1: Base address + 0
     - Player 2: Base address + 4
     - Player 3: Base address + 8
     - Player 4: Base address + 12
   - Automatic offset calculation based on player number

2. **Player Selection UI** (`AIAgentControlPanel.swift`)
   - Beautiful 4-button player selector
   - Shows selected player before connecting
   - Displays current player after connection
   - Cannot change player while AI is active

3. **Coordinator Updates** (`AIAgentCoordinator.swift`)
   - New `playerNumber` property (0-3)
   - `setPlayerNumber()` method with validation
   - Player info passed to memory injector
   - Status messages show player number

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Select Player
Before connecting to the emulator:
1. Open AI Agent Panel (purple AI button)
2. Click player button: **P1**, **P2**, **P3**, or **P4**
3. Blue = selected player

### Step 2: Start 2-Player Game
```bash
cd ~/NintendoEmulator

# Start a 2-player game
mupen64plus --windowed "Mario Kart 64.z64" &
mupen64plus --windowed "GoldenEye 007.z64" &
mupen64plus --windowed "Mario Tennis.z64" &
```

### Step 3: Connect AI as Player 2
1. Make sure Player 2 is selected (P2 button is blue)
2. Click "Auto-Detect Emulator"
3. Click "Connect"
4. Status shows: "Connected to [Game] as Player 2"

### Step 4: Play!
1. **You** control Player 1 with your controller/keyboard
2. **AI** controls Player 2 automatically
3. Click "Start AI Agent"
4. Now you're playing together! 🎉

## Memory Layout (Technical Details)

### N64 BUTTONS Array Structure
```c
// mupen64plus input plugin stores controllers as array
BUTTONS controller[4];  // 4 controllers, 4 bytes each

// Each BUTTONS is 4 bytes:
typedef struct {
    uint16_t buttons;  // Button bitmask (A, B, Start, etc.)
    int8_t   x_axis;   // Analog X (-127 to 127)
    int8_t   y_axis;   // Analog Y (-127 to 127)
} BUTTONS;

// Memory layout:
// [0x00000000] Player 1 controller state (4 bytes)
// [0x00000004] Player 2 controller state (4 bytes)
// [0x00000008] Player 3 controller state (4 bytes)
// [0x0000000C] Player 4 controller state (4 bytes)
```

### Scanning Strategy
The injector finds Player 1 controller state, then:
```swift
// Player 1 address found: 0x123456789ABC
baseAddress = 0x123456789ABC

// Calculate offsets
player1Address = baseAddress + (0 * 4) = 0x123456789ABC
player2Address = baseAddress + (1 * 4) = 0x123456789AC0
player3Address = baseAddress + (2 * 4) = 0x123456789AC4
player4Address = baseAddress + (3 * 4) = 0x123456789AC8
```
