## üöß Remaining Tasks (1-2 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Backend Deployment**

#### Day 1-2: OAuth Proxy Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual client secrets

# 3. Start OAuth proxy
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All 6 platforms configured (Twitch, YouTube, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok)
- [ ] Health check responds: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
- [ ] Test token exchange with one platform

#### Day 3-4: Authentication Service Setup
```bash
# 1. Start auth service
cd backend
node auth-service.js
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Password hashing with Argon2id confirmed
- [ ] JWT token generation works
- [ ] Login/logout cycle completes

#### Day 5: Environment Variables
```bash
# Run setup script
./scripts/setup-env.sh

# Verify
echo $TWITCH_CLIENT_ID
# Should output your client ID
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All 6 client IDs set in environment
- [ ] Terminal restarted / `source ~/.zshrc` run
- [ ] App picks up environment variables

#### Day 6-7: Certificate Pinning
```bash
# Generate and download certificates
./scripts/setup-certificates.sh
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Certificate downloaded successfully
- [ ] `.cer` file added to Xcode project
- [ ] App bundle includes certificate
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ Certificate pinning enabled"

---

### **Week 2: Testing & Deployment**

#### Day 8-9: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test OAuth flow for all 6 platforms
- [ ] Test user registration
- [ ] Test user login
- [ ] Test rate limiting (fail 6 times, verify lockout)
- [ ] Test ROM loading validation
- [ ] Test certificate pinning (reject invalid cert)

#### Day 10-11: Security Testing
- [ ] Verify no secrets in compiled binary: `strings .build/release/NintendoEmulator | grep -i secret`
- [ ] Attempt path traversal attack with `../../etc/passwd.n64`
- [ ] Try to load 200MB+ ROM (should reject)
- [ ] Test MITM attack with self-signed certificate (should fail)
- [ ] Verify password in network traffic is TLS-encrypted

#### Day 12-14: Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy OAuth proxy to production server
- [ ] Deploy auth service to production server
- [ ] Update app to point to production API
- [ ] Set up monitoring/logging
- [ ] Create rollback plan
- [ ] Soft launch to beta users (10-20 people)

| Brute Force Protection | None | üü† HIGH |
| Input Validation | Minimal | üü† HIGH |
| **Overall Risk** | - | üî¥ **HIGH** |

### **After Phase 1 (September 30)**
| Category | Status | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| Hardcoded Secrets | 0 (environment vars) | ‚úÖ LOW |
| Password Security | TLS + backend Argon2id | ‚úÖ LOW |
| MITM Protection | Certificate pinning | üü° MEDIUM* |
| Brute Force Protection | 5 attempts, 15-min lockout | ‚úÖ LOW |

# 1. Set up environment
./scripts/setup-env.sh

# 2. Start backend (in separate terminals)
cd backend
npm install
npm start                    # OAuth proxy on :3000
node auth-service.js         # Auth service on :3001

# 3. Build app

## üìà Timeline to Production

### **Option 1: Full Production** (Recommended)
- **Week 1:** Backend setup & testing
- **Week 2:** Integration & security testing
- **Week 3:** Beta testing (10-20 users)
- **Week 4:** Public launch

**Total:** 4 weeks
**Risk:** LOW
**User Experience:** EXCELLENT

### **Option 2: Fast Track** (Minimum Viable)
- **Days 1-2:** Backend deployment
- **Days 3-4:** Integration testing
- **Day 5:** Limited beta (5 users)
- **Day 6-7:** Public launch

**Total:** 1 week
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**User Experience:** GOOD (some OAuth may not work)

### **Option 3: Offline Mode First** (Safest)
- **Today:** Ship app WITHOUT cloud features
- **Week 1-2:** Backend development
- **Week 3:** Push update enabling cloud features

**Total:** 3 weeks to full feature set
**Risk:** VERY LOW
**User Experience:** GOOD (local gaming works day 1)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### **Until Backend Deployed:**
- ‚ùå OAuth login will fail for all platforms (expected)
- ‚ùå User registration/login will fail (expected)
- ‚úÖ ROM loading works (local files)
- ‚úÖ Emulator core works (single player)
- ‚úÖ Input controls work
- ‚úÖ Save states work (local)

### **After Backend Deployed:**
- ‚úÖ OAuth login works for all 6 platforms
- ‚úÖ User registration/login works
- ‚úÖ Full cloud features enabled
- ‚úÖ Social features work

---

## üéÆ What Works Right Now (Without Backend)

Users can:
- ‚úÖ Browse ROM library
- ‚úÖ Load ROMs securely (with validation)
- ‚úÖ Play games (emulator core functional)
- ‚úÖ Use controllers
- ‚úÖ Save/load states locally
- ‚úÖ Configure input settings
- ‚úÖ Customize UI themes

Users CANNOT:
- ‚ùå Log in with social accounts
- ‚ùå Register user accounts
- ‚ùå Stream to Twitch/YouTube
- ‚ùå Share gameplay online

**This is perfect for:**
- Private beta testing
- Development/QA builds
- Offline gaming experience
